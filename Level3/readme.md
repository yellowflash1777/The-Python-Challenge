"One small letter, surrounded by EXACTLY three big bodyguards on each of its sides."
 <br>

So according to the statement solution is to find one lowercase letter surrounded by exactly 3 uppercase letters  <br> 
To solve this we create a function according to our codition <br>
 <br>
 HINT : we need to collect all the middle letters of the format xXXX<u>x</u>XXXx
where X is any upercase letter and x is any lowercase letter <br>

After solving this we get the solution 'linkedlist' <br>
