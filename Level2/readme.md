<br>
It is written that : <br>

"recognize the characters. maybe they are in the book,
but MAYBE they are in the page source." <br> 

## Solution

So we click view source and check the commented part which says : <br>


"find rare characters in the mess below:" <br>

 followed with a large string of characters <br>

 To solve this we can use counter library to count the occurance of each character and then find the rarest characters

 In this case the rarest characters spells out "equality" so we use it in our url to navigate to next page
